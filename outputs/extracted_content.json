    "introduction": "INTRODUCTION\nS\nINCE Bitcoin’s inception in late 2008, cryptocurrencies\nand the underlying blockchain technology have piqued\ngreat interest from the ﬁnancial industry and society as a\nwhole. Blockchain is widely cited as a fully decentralized\nsystem and a secure-by-design technology. The blockchain\nitself is a database that keeps track of all transactions occurred\nin the network and is replicated at every participating node.\nIt essentially realizes a distributed ledger without relying on\na central authority to bootstrap the trust among participants\nor to clear the transactions. It also does not assume trust\namong the participating nodes. Blockchain is meant to enable\ntrusted computation among a group of mutually distrustful\nc⃝2020 IEEE.

Blockchain and its implications on supply chain operations \nBlockchain is an innovative, decentralized, and distributive “state-of-the-art” technology, which maintains confidentiality, in­\ntegrity, and availability of all the transactions and data. It is a shared, open and distributed ledger that can help store/record data and \ntransactions backed by a cryptographic value (Choi, 2020a) across a peer-to-peer network (Chang et al., 2019a; Choi et al., 2019). \nBlockchain is a digital shared ledger which is distributed over the network. Once the records are added they cannot be edited without \nchanging the previous records (with the consent of all/majority of involved parties), which makes it very safe to business operations. \nIt has endless applications in various fields like designing smart contracts to track frauds in finance or securely share medical records \nbetween healthcare professionals.
